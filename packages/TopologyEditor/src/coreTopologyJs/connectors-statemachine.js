            // it seems to make good aesthetic sense to do that. outside of that, the control point is positioned
            // at 'curviness' pixels away along the normal to the straight line connecting the two anchors.

            // there may be two improvements to this.  firstly, we might actually support the notion of avoiding nodes
            // in the UI, or at least making a good effort at doing so.  if a connection would pass underneath some node,
            // for example, we might increase the distance the control point is away from the midpoint in a bid to
            // steer it around that node.  this will work within limits, but i think those limits would also be the likely
            // limits for, once again, aesthetic good sense in the layout of a chart using these connectors.
            //
            // the second possible change is actually two possible changes: firstly, it is possible we should gradually
            // decrease the 'curviness' as the distance between the anchors decreases; start tailing it off to 0 at some
            // point (which should be configurable).  secondly, we might slightly increase the 'curviness' for connectors
            // with respect to how far their anchor is from the center of its respective face. this could either look cool,
            // or stupid, and may indeed work only in a way that is so subtle as to have been a waste of time.
